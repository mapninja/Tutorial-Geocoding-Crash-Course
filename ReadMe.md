### Specialty Geocoding APIs:
 * [Yandex](https://tech.yandex.com/maps/doc/geocoder/desc/concepts/limits-docpage/) - Geocoding and Routing API for Russia, Eastern Europe and Western Asia.  
 * [MapMyIndia.com](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/) - Geocoding and Routing API (plus many others!) for India


### Things to talk about:
## Basics of Geocoding

Geocoding, in the context of this service, is the use of reference datasets (such as street networks, administrative boundaries and gazetteers) to convert text-based locations (such as street addresses, administrative units or placenames) into explicit locations, or latitude/longitude coordinate pairs, in most use cases. These resulting coordinates are often used to extract values from other datasets, based upon location, or for measurement of proximity to other features and phenomena.

* Street Addresses
* Placenames
* Administrative Boundaries
* Esoteric Localities
* High-risk and PHI Geocoding

## Preparing Your Address Table
[Formatting a Table for Use in ArcGIS](http://support.esri.com/EN/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/30727)

### Things GIS hates about your tables:  
* Spaces or special characters (other than _ ) in field names  
* Field Names that start with a number  
* Empty Rows  
* Merged Cells  
* Excel Formulas

### Specifics on tabular data for geocoding
* Most geocoding services prefer street addresses in a single field, with City, State, Postal Codes, etc... in separate fields.  
* For placenames, concatenate administrative units, as follows:

```Dallas, TX, USA```

#### Collapse your addresses/placenames into a table of UNIQUE addresses/placenames!  

That is, if you have a database of 2 million addresses, but there are many duplicates, use a summary or frequency tool to collapse those records into unique localities. For example, the Photogrammar data we will use with our custom ArcGIS Address Locator has 98k+ records, but only about 4000 unique locations. They can easily be joined back to the original dataset in a many-to-one join.

This should always be the first step in a geocoding job, as it saves time, processing and often credits or money.


# Exercise #1 - Using the locator.stanford.edu Address Locators with ArcGIS Pro
### Example Data  
We'll use one file from the **[data](https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS)** (at [https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS](https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS) ) for this exercise:

* **Evictions_94102.csv** - Download the *raw* version of this file into your working folder. Open it to ensure it contains comma-separated values, and not HTML.

The Stanford Geospatial Center maintains a Geocoding Server, based upon Esri's ArcGIS Server technology. The server currently provides geocoding services for US Street Addresses, postal codes and administrative boundaries.

### To access the Address Locator services:

1. Open ArcGIS Pro, and start a new Project, called "Geocoding"
2. Double-click the **Add ArcGIS Server** item    
3. Leave the default "**Use GIS Services**" option, click **Next>**
4. For the '**Server URL**' use: [https://locator.stanford.edu/arcgis](https://locator.stanford.edu/arcgis)  
5.  **For 'User Name' use your SUNetID (prefixed with the 'WIN\' domain) as WIN\SUNetID**  
6.  Enter the **password** associated with your **SUNetID** and check the option to **Save Username/Password**  
7.  Click **Finish**  
8. Under **GIS Servers** > **arcgis on locator.stanford.edu** > **geocode** folder, you will find the **USA_StreetAddress** Address Locator.


### Running the geocoding job  
1. **Drag and drop** the **USA_StreetAddress** Address Locator from *GIS Servers > arcgis on locator.stanford.edu > geocode* into the **Map Document** to make it the default.
2. **Drag** the **Evictions_94102.csv** into the **Map Document** and right-click to **open** it to **examine the attributes**, paying attention to the field names for the address fields.
3. **Right-click** on **Evictions_94102.csv** and select **Geocode addresses...** and then **click OK** to use the default locator you set before.
  * If at this point you hit an error, save your map document, close ArcMap, re-open it, and repeat this step. It often works on the second try.
4. Set the appropriate fields in the **Address input fields** options
5. Open the **Geocoding options** and examine them, but accept the server **defaults**.
6. Select the path into which you want the **Output shapefile** to be written.
7. **Click OK** to run the geocoder.
8. Wait until the progress bar shows 100% and says **Completed**.
9. Click **Rematch** to explore the results, try to **manually match any unmatched records**.
  * In the **Show results:** drop down, select **Unmatched Addresses**.
  * In the results, select a single address row.
  * In the **Candidates** pane below, review the matching options, and select the right address. You can use the **Score** as a guideline on how closely each candidate matches the selected address.
  * Click on the **Match** button to save the match.
  * Repeat for all unmatched addresses.
10. Once matching has been completed, **Close** the Rematch Dialog.
11. Right-click the newly added results layer in the Table of Contents, and **Zoom to Layer**
12. Add a **Basemap** for context.  


### Note:  

There are a number of ways to leverage the SGC Address Locator server:  
1. Use the REST API to geocode using Python: [https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/batch-geocoding/](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/batch-geocoding/)  
2. Use Claudia Engels' R Script: [https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/ArcGIS_geocoding](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/ArcGIS_geocoding)   
3. Use ArcGIS Online, logged in using your SUNetID and Password, and select the default geocoder when prompted, after adding a table of addresses.  

## Exercise #2 - Building an Address Locator with ArcMap
### Example Data  

We'll use two files from the **[data](https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS)** (at [https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS](https://github.com/mapninja/Tutorial-Geocoding-in-ArcGIS) ) for this exercise:

* **US_county_1930_conflated.shp** - the reference data we will use to build our geocoder. Download all the files from the *US_county_1930_conflated* folder.
* **photogrammar_image_count.csv** - Download the *raw* version of this file, and make sure it contains comma-separated values, not HTML.

### Prepare the reference data

1. **Open ArcMap** and bring the **US_county_1930_conflated.shp** data into an empty **Map Document**
2. **Open the attribute table**, using **Add Field** create a new **Text** field called **PLACE**, with a **length of 100**
3. **Right-click** on the new **PLACE** field header and ***Field Calculator***
  * If you get a warning about doing a calculate outside an edit session, click *Yes*.
4. Use the following code to **concatenate** the **COUNTY** and **STATE** fields, adding appropriate commas and '**United States**':  

```[NHGISNAM] &" County, " & [STATENAM]&", United States"```   

This should result in values like this:  

```Adair County, Missouri, United States```  

### Create the Address Locator  
1. In the **Catalog Panel of ArcMap**, **right-click** on your **'data' folder** and select **New>Address locator...**  
2. Under **Address Locator Style** select **General - Single Field** as the **locator type**.
3. Set **Reference Data** to **US_county_1930_conflated.shp**.
4. In the Field Map, select ***keyfield** and in the second column, set it to **PLACE**.
5. Confirm the **Output Address Locator** path, and click **OK** to run the tool.
6. **Right click** on the resulting **Address Locator** and inspect the **Properties** to see what changes you can make.
7. Close the properties and **drag the locator into the Map Document** to make it the default locator.

### Running the Geocoding Job  
1. Bring the **photogrammar_image_count.csv** table into **ArcMap**.
2. Right-click to **select** **Geocode Addresses**, and verify that your new address locator is selected, otherwise select it. Click **OK**
3. **Change** to **Single Field** and Select **Column 1** as the **key**
4. Click on **Geocoding Options** and:
  * Change the **Spelling Sensitivity** and **Minimum Match Score** to **50**
  * **Uncheck** **Match if Candidates tie**
7. Click **OK**, twice, to **run the geocoder**.
8. Wait until the progress bar shows 100% *and* says **Completed**.
9. Click **Rematch** to **explore the results**, then click **Close**.
10. Use a **Spatial Join** to add the **Geocoding Results attributes** to the original **US_county_1930_conflated.shp** file

### Example Data
* **TexasHealthByCounty.csv** - is the table we will geocode

### Getting Ready for the Tutorial
This tutorial will demonstrate how to use OpenRefine to submit URLs to web-based Geocoding APIs in order to augment an existing dataset with things like latitude & longitude coordinates, elevation values, drive times, etc...

OpenRefine is a piece of open-source software that allows you to manipulate data in many different ways. It's not just great for geocoding and augmenting datasets, but is really great for cleaning up 'dirty' data, too.

For the needs of this tutorial, OpenRefine allows us to build and submit URLs to a web service (like a geocoding API) over and over tens, hundreds, even thousands or more times, saving us the trouble of typing a URL into a browser and copy&pasting values, one at a time. OpenRefine runs in your browser, but does so locally by installing itself as a sort of server running on your own machine.  OpenRefine used to be called GoogleRefine, but has recently been re-branded, so much of the support materials you will find on-line will still refer to GoogleRefine.  

![Open Refine Logo](/images/logo-openrefine-40.png)

You will, of course, need to download OpenRefine in order to complete this tutorial. You can get the appropriate version for your operating system from [OpenRefine.org] (http://openrefine.org/). In the meantime, there are 3 videos on the OpenRefine frontpage. You should take a look at all three, because they give a great, concise overview of many of the capabilities of OpenRefine. For the purposes of this tutorial, it wouldn't hurt to watch the 3rd video, linked here:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5tsyz3ibYzk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5tsyz3ibYzk)

You might also want to take a look at this page on "___Understanding Expressions___" in OpenRefine:

And, here's the full Documentation Wiki:

## What is an [Geocoding] API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is, essentially, a set of instructions that allows computer programs to pass data back and forth.  In the following exercises, we will be using several Web APIs.  The Web APIs we will use allow you to submit a URL just like when you type a URL into your browser address bar.  The important difference is that the URL we are submitting has a bit of data (an address or coordinate pair) that we want to know something about. Rather than giving us back an HTML file that instructs our browser to retrieve images, text and other object and arrange them into a webpage, the Web APIs we will be using give us back information about the address/coordinate pair we submitted.    

# Exercise #3 Geocoding with the Geonames.org API
## Create an Account

[http://www.geonames.org/login](http://www.geonames.org/login)

## Examine the API Docs

[http://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html](http://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html)

We're interested in the ___Search___ API

[http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html](http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html)

## Use the Advanced Search Box to Help Build a URL  

[http://www.geonames.org/advanced-search.html?](http://www.geonames.org/advanced-search.html?)

1. Search for 'Bexar County, Texas'; Country='United States'; Feature Class='Country,State,Region...'

The resulting URL should look like this:  

```
http://www.geonames.org/advanced-search.html?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=
```  

Open up a new Browser Tab and Cut&Paste the part of the URL from the 'q=' parameter, all the way to the end of the URL, like this:  

```
q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=
```  

We're going to build our API Url from this. First, paste the API Base URL in front of the part you just pasted:  

Here is the Base URL:  

```
api.geonames.org/search?
```  

Here is what it should look like after pasting the two together:  

```
api.geonames.org/search?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=
```

You can go ahead and hit enter to submit the URL. WHat you will get is an XML file, with an error message. This is because to use the API, you are required to identify yourself each time you submit a query. Now, you need to add a parameter that identifies you. You will add the username parameter, using your own username that you created when you registered with Geonames.org:

The parameter is:  

```
&username=?????????
```  

Where you will replace the ???????? with your Geonames Username. Just put this right on the end of the URL you are building:  

```
api.geonames.org/search?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=&username=?????????
```  

Now try hitting enter to submit the URL, again. You should see something like the below (it's a large amount of text, since we haven't limited the returns, yet):  

```XML
This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.
<geonames style="MEDIUM">
<totalResultsCount>14</totalResultsCount>
<geoname>
<toponymName>Bexar County</toponymName>
<name>Bexar County</name>
<lat>29.44896</lat>
<lng>-98.52002</lng>
<geonameId>4674023</geonameId>
<countryCode>US</countryCode>
<countryName>United States</countryName>
<fcl>A</fcl>
<fcode>ADM2</fcode>
</geoname>
<geoname>
<toponymName>City of Elmendorf</toponymName>
<name>City of Elmendorf</name>
<lat>29.25547</lat>
<lng>-98.31695</lng>
<geonameId>7173379</geonameId>
<countryCode>US</countryCode>
<countryName>United States</countryName>
<fcl>A</fcl>
<fcode>ADMD</fcode>
</geoname>
and so on...
```  

Now we will add the last two parameters to the URL and see what the result looks like. First, we want to return JSON, instead of XML, so let's add the paramet 'JSON' just after the 'search' and '?' in the URL, so our URL looks like this:  

```
http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=&username=??????
```  

Hit enter and notice that returned format has changed (also note that I have formatted the following for easier viewing and that the JSON you get back will not have line breaks and indents):  

```JSON
{
  "totalResultsCount": 14,
  "geonames": [
    {
      "adminCode1": "TX",
      "lng": "-98.52002",
      "geonameId": 4674023,
      "toponymName": "Bexar County",
      "countryId": "6252001",
      "fcl": "A",
      "population": 1714773,
      "countryCode": "US",
      "name": "Bexar County",
      "fclName": "country, state, region,...",
      "countryName": "United States",
      "fcodeName": "second-order administrative division",
      "adminName1": "Texas",
      "lat": "29.44896",
      "fcode": "ADM2"
    },
    {
      "adminCode1": "TX",
      "lng": "-98.31695",
      "geonameId": 7173379,
      "toponymName": "City of Elmendorf",
      "countryId": "6252001",
      "fcl": "A",
      "population": 1488,
      "countryCode": "US",
      "name": "City of Elmendorf",
      "fclName": "country, state, region,...",
      "countryName": "United States",
      "fcodeName": "administrative division",
      "adminName1": "Texas",
      "lat": "29.25547",
      "fcode": "ADMD"
    },

    And so on...
```

Finally, let's use the **&maxRows=1** parameter to tell Geonames to only return a single row of information, and the **&featureCode=ADM2** parameter (we only want County Names, returned), so that our URL looks like this:  


```
http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=&username=?????&maxRows=1&featureCode=ADM2
```  

Hit enter to test the URL and you should return the following (again, unformatted):  

```JSON
{
  "totalResultsCount": 1,
  "geonames": [
    {
      "countryId": "6252001",
      "adminCode1": "TX",
      "countryName": "United States",
      "fclName": "country, state, region,...",
      "countryCode": "US",
      "lng": "-98.52002",
      "fcodeName": "second-order administrative division",
      "toponymName": "Bexar County",
      "fcl": "A",
      "name": "Bexar County",
      "fcode": "ADM2",
      "geonameId": 4674023,
      "lat": "29.44896",
      "adminName1": "Texas",
      "population": 1714773
    }
  ]
}
```
## Bulk Geocoding Against the Geonames API with OpenRefine
Now it's time to start up OpenRefine and use the URL we've just created to submit a Geocoding Request for each of our Texas Counties.

1. Start OpenRefine by double-clicking the Google-Refine.exe (yours will likely have a version number or it might even be called OpenRefine, if you downloaded the Beta release)

2. Click on the **Create Project** link.

3. Select the option to **Get data from this computer** and Click on the **Choose Files** button.

4. Browse to the TexasHealthByCounty.csv and Select it. Click Next

5. Make sure the data is properly formatted in the Preview, change the **Parse data as** parameters until the data is properly formatted. Click **Create Project** in the upper right corner of the page.

## Concatenating Fields in OpenRefine  
If you haven't already, now is a good time to take a look at the basics of the GREL (Google Refine Expresion Language)  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Understanding-Expressions.  

We will first concatenate the County and State fields, inserting "County, " as well, for a well formatted placename.  

1. Click on the Drop-down Arrow next to the County fieldname and go to **Edit Column>Add Column Based on This One>**  

2. Name your new column 'placename'  

3. Paste the following into the Expression Window:  


```
value+" County, Texas"
```

![OpenRefine Expression Window](/images/Geocoding_7.png)


4. Notice that your Preview updates and you should see 'Anderson County, Texas' as the result for the first record. Click OK to calculate the concatenation for all of the records in the table.  

## Using Our URL as a Template

Now is the time to return to your URL you created, and Copy it from the Browser Address Bar. Again, it should be something like this (with ?????? replaced by your Geonames Username):  

```
http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON?q=Bexar+County%2C+Texas&country=US&featureClass=A&continentCode=&username=???????&maxRows=1&featureCode=ADM2
```  

1. Now Click on the Drop-down Arrownext to the '**placename**' field and go to **Edit Column>Add Column by Fetching URL**  

2. Paste your __template__ URL into the Expression Window (this will result in a null values in the preview, that is fine):  

3. Now, Copy the following text:  


```
'+ escape(value,'url')+'
```  

4. **Carefully** select the following text from the URL you just pasted into the Expression window and replace it by pasting the text you just copied from the clipboard"  


```
Bexar+County%2C+Texas
```  

5. Add single quotes (') to the beginning and end of the Expression and you should see the syntax error dismissed.  

6. Name your New Column "**GEONAMESJSON1**" and set the Throttle Delay value to '200' milliseconds (this will tell OpenRefine to submit 5 Geocode Requests per second).  

![OpenRefine Expression Window](/images/Geocoding_8.png)  

Wait for the geocoding to finish (a few minutes, HOORAY FOR PROGRESS MESSAGES!) and you should have something like this:  

![OpenRefine Expression Window](/images/Geocoding_9.png)  

## Parsing the JSON for what you need  

### What is JSON?  
For our purposes, we don't really need to go deeply into what JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is. It is enough for you to know that it is a format for storing and exchanging data in human readable text format and that it is an output format for all of the APIs we will use, as well as most web-based data APIs.  
### Making sense of JSON  
OK, so that JSON we got back might be a little intimidating if you aren't used to looking at code, but if you just bend your knees and take a deep breath, then look closely, you will see that there is actually some useful information in there! In fact, if what we are doing is geocoding placenames, it's got exactly what we need on the line that begins with **"geometry":**  

```
"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-89.84861, 30.79083]},
```  

**See them!? There are longitude/latitude coordinates in there! That's what we are after!**  You can make the JSON data even more readable with:  

[http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/).   

Copy&Paste the JSON from the example we clicked earlier into the [http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) text tab and click on the Format Button in the Main Menu. Then switch to the Viewer Tab...  

![JSONViewer Collapsed](/images/JSONViewerCollapsed.png)

Then, Expand all of the elements in the hierarchy so that you have something that looks like this:  

![JSONViewer Collapsed](/images/JSONViewerExpanded.png)

You can see that the latitude and longitude coordinates are under the coordinates object. If you track back through the hierarchy from the coordinates object, you will find that the address of the longitude coordinate [-89.84861] is:  

```
resultSet.features[0].geometry.coordinates[0]
```


Cut and paste one of your JSON records into the text tab of the Online JSON Viewer at http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/, then click **Format** and then click on the **Viewer** Tab and expand all of the elements in the panel on the left:  

![OpenRefine Expression Window](/images/Geocoding_11.png)  

```
value.parseJson().geonames[0].lat
```  

![OpenRefine Expression Window](/images/Geocoding_10.png)  

```
value.parseJson().geonames[0].lng  
```  
# Geocoding with Geolocate
___this section in progress___

# Geolocate Tulane  
### Limits
There are no licensing restrictions on the Tulane Geolocate service. The API can be used for any geocoding purpose and for any amount of data. That said, the service does have some technical limitations. I have observed that a more stable result is achieved when using no more than 5 requests per second. Another thing to consider is the purpose for which Geolocate was created. Geolocate is very good at geocoding to administrative boundaries, but was not designed to geocode street addresses, so if that is what you have, you will have to use an alternative service.

Here are the Geolocate Parameters, once again:

![JSONViewer Collapsed] (/images/Geolocate_API_Parameters.png)

Most of these are fairly straightforward. The ones that most concern us  for the current tutorial are the following:

  __locality__ - This is the "address" or placename you are actually looking for. Geolocate is actually built to handle fairly esoteric localities (like "3 miles north of the confluence of the X and Y rivers").

  __country__ - This is the country that your locality is in. This is a required parameter for all Geolocate Searches.

  __state__ - This is listed as an optional parameter in the Geolocate JSON Wrapper DOc, but it is __REQUIRED__ if you are geocoding data within the United States and set your 'country=USA'.


### API Overview

Again, here’s the basic structure of the URLs you will submit to the Geolocate JSON Wrapper Web API:

```
http://www.museum.tulane.edu/webservices/geolocatesvcv2/glcwrap.aspx?Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON
```

From the sample above:
```
http://www.museum.tulane.edu/webservices/geolocatesvcv2/glcwrap.aspx?
```
...is the base URL of the (Geolocate Search API) [http://www.museum.tulane.edu/geolocate/]...

```
Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON
```

...are the parameters of the search. In this case, there are four basic parameters to the search.


## Exercise #4 (in progress) Geocoding with the Tulane Geolocate API  

### Submitting a URL  

Here’s the basic structure of one of the URLs you will submit to the one of the Web APIs we will be working with:

```
http://www.museum.tulane.edu/webservices/geolocatesvcv2/glcwrap.aspx?Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON
```

From the sample above:  

```

...is the base URL of the (Geolocate Search API) [http://www.museum.tulane.edu/geolocate/]...  

```
Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON
```  

...are the parameters of the search. In this case, there are four basic parameters to the search...  

```
Country=USA
```  
...this first **parameter** indicates to the Geolocate API what country the placename you are searching for is in.  This is a **required** parameter in the Geolocate API.  

```  
&Locality=bogalusa
```  

...this is the **placename** you are searching for.  

```
&state=la
```  

...this is the name of the state that the locality you are looking for is in. In the Geolocate API, this is a required parameter if you are searching for placenames within the USA.  


```
&fmt=JSON
```
...this parameter indicates the type of output you would like to get back from the Geolocate API. Currently, the Geolocate API is able to return JSON or GeoJSON.  We will discuss these formats, and their differences, later.   

Here are the rest of the supported parameters from the Geolocate API:

### Getting back JSON  
For the time being, try submitting the above search to the Geolocate API by clicking on this link:  

[http://www.museum.tulane.edu/webservices/geolocatesvcv2/glcwrap.aspx?Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON  ](http://www.museum.tulane.edu/webservices/geolocatesvcv2/glcwrap.aspx?Country=USA&Locality=bogalusa&state=la&fmt=JSON  )

What you get back should look like this (_sans_ the fancy syntax highlighting Github does):  

```JSON
